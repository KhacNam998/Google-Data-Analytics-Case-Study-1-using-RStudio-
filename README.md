## Scenario

I am assigned as a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

## Background:

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. My manager, Lily Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members.

## Stakeholders:

Primary stakeholder: Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

### Secondary stakeholder:

Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels

Cyclistic marketing analytics team: I joined this team of data analysts six months ago. We are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy and help Cyclistic achieve them.
